                    Patients in Primary Health care facilities deserve care led by Clinical practioners—the most highly

                    and education, the COAZ vigorously defends the Clinical practice against scope of practice

                        There is room for improvement in the Zambia health system but allowing non-clinicians such as
                        nurse practitioners (NPs) or Community health practitioners to diagnose and treat patients,
                        especially at primary health care levels and secondary health care levels without any physician
                        oversight is a step in the wrong direction. The best way to support high-quality care and lower
                        costs is to keep clinicians as the leader of the health care teams </p>

                        There is substantive evidence is diagnostic gaps. The University teaching Hospital – cancer

                        This shows that there is a GAP in diagnostics in Primary care sites </p>

                        Zambian people in under served areas deserve better health care services. COAZ is advocating for

                        Clinicians are highly trained in diagnostics. Nurse practitioners and axillary providers have a
                        limited scope to provide comprehensive care services. They require clinical guidance from
                        Clinicians </p>
