                    particularly for those in under served areas. Many people in these communities either lack access to

                        We advocating for the expansion of the National Health Insurance scheme to ensure coverage for
                        individuals in underserved communities. This includes advocating for policies that prioritize
                        the inclusion of rural and remote populations, as well as vulnerable groups such as low-income

                        Additionally, we support efforts to improve the accessibility of insurance enrollment through
                        community-based outreach programs and simplified registration processes.
